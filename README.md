## Installing / Getting started

To get started, run the following commands in the terminal.

```shell

npm start

These commands will install BookyBooks and run the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

BookyBooks was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). See [CRA.md](./CRA.md) for additional information.

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements.

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/bookybooks.git
cd bookybooks/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy bookybooks -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.
